PacControl v1.0, Scott Louvau, 2018.
This software is used to keep the climate system running all night in a 2017+ Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid.
The car turns off automatically after 30 minutes when in Park or plugged in.
This software, when connected to a relay which connects the Start Button 12v and signal wires,
will turn the car off and on again every 28 minutes for 12 hours.
