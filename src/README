PacControl v1.0, Scott Louvau, 2018-2022.
This software is used to keep the climate system running all night in a 2017+ Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid.
The car turns off automatically after 30 minutes when in Park or plugged in.
This software, when connected to a relay which connects the Start Button 12v and signal wires,
will turn the car off and on again every 28 minutes for 12 hours.


Configure this to run on boot
=============================
sudo nano /etc/rc.local

Before the "exit 0" line, add this line:
/home/pi/PacControl/src/pacControl >> /home/pi/PacControl/src/pacControl.log &


Configure 1280x720 screen resolution
====================================
To set the Raspberry Pi to output a low video resolution which you can see on the 'Overhead DVD System by Mopar' in your Pacifica,
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
