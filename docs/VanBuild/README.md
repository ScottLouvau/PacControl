Camping in our Pacifica Hybrid required a way to keep the climate system running, but also an interior build that had room for the four of us to sleep and for our stuff.

We built a bed platform for the adults just behind the second row seats, and each of our kids sleeps across one of the front rows. 

The kid bed platforms are 17" x 48" OSB boards wrapped with 1/2" foam and covers and then inserted into rectangular sleeping bags. They are just large enough for the kids and fully fill the space between the seat backs and the next row up or the dashboard, so they don't move around. The seat bottoms are not flat, so we bought some triangular foam yoga wedges from Amazon which flatten them. The one which goes across the front row also has two square foam pads so that it rests evenly on the front seats and the center console. Keeping the sleeping bags wrapped around the bed platforms allows us to store them and set them up on one step and keeps all of the kid bedding contained.

The adult bed fits behind the second row, and is *just* long enough for me (5' 10") to stretch out when the second row seats are tilted and slid all the way forward. We created a raised bed platform both to allow us to store a lot of stuff under the bed (in 6" x 

We initially tried just putting our camping sleeping pads and bags on the floor, but it's sloped downward significantly as you move forward from the trunk, and there wasn't enough length from the trunk to the base of the second row seats for me.
